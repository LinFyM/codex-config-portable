# PDF Skill

## When to use
- Read or review PDF content where layout and visuals matter.
- Create PDFs programmatically with reliable formatting.
- Validate final rendering before delivery.

## Workflow
1. Prefer visual review: render PDF pages to PNGs and inspect them.
   - Use `pdftoppm` if available.
   - Use an available renderer or an appropriate authorized local installation. If rendering remains unavailable, complete structural/content checks and report the specific unverified layout scope.
2. Use `reportlab` to generate PDFs when creating new documents.
3. Use `pdfplumber` (or `pypdf`) for text extraction and quick checks; do not rely on it for layout fidelity.
4. After layout changes, render and inspect affected pages. Inspect the full final render for a new document or global style/pagination changes.

## Temp and output conventions
- Use `tmp/pdfs/` for intermediate files; delete when done.
- Write final artifacts under `output/pdf/` when working in this repo.
- Keep filenames stable and descriptive.

## Dependencies (install if missing)
Prefer `uv` for dependency management.

Python packages:
```
uv pip install reportlab pdfplumber pypdf
```
If `uv` is unavailable:
```
python3 -m pip install reportlab pdfplumber pypdf
```
System tools (for rendering):
```
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install poppler

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils
```

If installation isn't possible in this environment, tell the user which dependency is missing and how to install it locally.

## Environment
No required environment variables.

## Rendering command
```
pdftoppm -png $INPUT_PDF $OUTPUT_PREFIX
```

## Quality expectations
- Maintain polished visual design: consistent typography, spacing, margins, and section hierarchy.
- Avoid rendering issues: clipped text, overlapping elements, broken tables, black squares, or unreadable glyphs.
- Charts, tables, and images must be sharp, aligned, and clearly labeled.
- Use fonts that render the requested language and punctuation correctly; replace unsupported glyphs only when observed.
- Citations and references must be human-readable; never leave tool tokens or placeholder strings.

## Final checks
- Inspect the final render at the scope above and fix observed defects. If rendering is unavailable, complete content/structure checks and report the unverified layout scope.
- Confirm headers/footers, page numbering, and section transitions look polished.
- Remove task-owned intermediate files after verification and delivery unless needed for a requested revision or the user asked to retain them.
